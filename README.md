<h1>Tic-Tac-Toe in C++</h1>

This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic two-player game Tic-Tac-Toe in C++. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and each player takes turns marking a square with their symbol, either an "X" or an "O". The player who succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. If all the squares are filled and no player has won, the game is considered a draw.



<h2>Requirements</h2>
A C++ compiler


<h2>How to Play</h2>
Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/hemanth-kumar-boddeda/Tic-Tac-Toe-Console-Game/blob/main/Tic-Tac-Toe/ttt.cpp

Navigate to the repository directory and compile the program using the following command:

Copy code
g++ -o tic-tac-toe tic-tac-toe.cpp
Run the program using the following command:
bash
Copy code
./tic-tac-toe
The game will display an empty 3x3 board and prompt each player to enter their move by specifying the row and column they want to place their symbol in. The players take turns until one player succeeds in placing three of their symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, or until all the squares are filled. The game will display the result and the final state of the board.


<h2>Documentation</h2>
The code is well-commented and should be easy to understand for someone with some experience in C++. If you have any questions or comments about the code, feel free to open an issue in the repository.



<h2>Contributions</h2>
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes.
